# Predictive-analysis

## Introduction
Regression is used to model the relationship between variables. For this task , I imported the 
necessary libraries and the houseprice dataset .I described the data sets and checked for null values 
which I couldn’t find .
I checked for the relationship between the features and targeted column by carrying out a 
correlation analysis to know how changes in the features are associated with changes in the target 
variable

## Is there a way of visualising your model? (Possibly just one or two input/feature variable(s).)
I used a simple linear regression (y = βX + c + ε) in visualising the model with Price column as 
dependent variable which can be found on the Y axis and Sqft_living column as the independent 
variable which can be found on the X axis . The table below shows the blue line which represents the 
linear relationship and with an R2 of 0.50 or 50% which is suitable to make prediction for the 
dataset . The figure below shows the Simple linear regression with two feature
